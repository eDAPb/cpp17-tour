	// 10.2 Output
	// In <ostream>, the I/O stream library defines output for every built-in
	// type.
	//
	// The operator << ("put to") is used as an output operator on obj
	// of type ostream; cout is the standard output stream and cerr is the
	// standard for reporting errors. By default, values written to cout are
	// converted to a sequence of characters.
	//
	// Places the characters 1 and 0 on the standard output stream.
	//		std::cout << 10;
	// The same can be done equivalently through a variable.
	// 
	// When outputting several items you could do it in separate lines. But most
	// prefer to chain the items using <<
	//		std::cout << "the value is " << 10 << '\n';
	//
	// A character constant is a character enclosed in single quotes.
	// Note: char is ouputted as a character rather than a numerical value.
	//		char c = 'c';
