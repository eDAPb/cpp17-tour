    // 4.2 Concrete Types
    // Concrete types behave just like built-in types but have their own
    // semantics and sets of operations.
    // For example, vectors and strings are much like built-in arrays, except
    // they are better behaved.
    // The defining characteristic of a concrete type is that its
    // representation is part of its definition. In other words, the way the
    // object is represented in memory is fixed.
    // Therefore, if the representation changes, a user must recompile.
    // To increase flexibility, a concrete type can keep major parts of its
    // representation on free store (dynamic memory, heap) and access them
    // through the part stored in the class object itself.
    // Unlike abstract types concrete types can be instantiated.

    // 4.2.1 An Arithmetic Type
    // The class definition itself only contains the operations requiring
    // access to the representation.
