    // A sequence of elem of a given type, contiguously stored in mem.
    // Typical implementations of std::vector involve a handle holding 
    // ptrs to the first elem, one-past-the-last elem, and one-past-the-last
    // allocated space. It also holds an allocator from which std::vector
    // can acquire and release mem.
    //      The default alloc uses new and delete to acquire and release elem.
