    // 3.2 Separate Compilation
    // C++ supports the notion of separate compilation where user code
    // sees only declarations of the types and functions used.
    //
    // Definitions of those types are held in separate source files and
    // are compiled separately.
    //
    // These features can be used to organize a program into a set of
    // semi-independent code fragments. A library is often a collection
    // of separately compiled code fragments (e.g., functions).
